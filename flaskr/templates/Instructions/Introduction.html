<h1>Learning Italian Intonation</h1>
<p>

Welcome! In this study, we are testing a training for intonation (the melody of speech) in Italian, distinguishing statements and questions.

You will start by reading a few sentences out loud. Then you will do the training, where you get to compare your intonation to a native speaker of Italian, and you will finish by reading a few more sentences out loud.

Next week youâ€™ll complete a similar training, and then a week later there will be a quick follow-up.

</p>
<p>
    Things you'll need:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A quiet space to work in.</li>
    <li>A microphone (if you have a quality mic that is best).</li>
    <li>An internet connection</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h4><a class="action" href="{{ url_for('/instructions.mic_test', post=post) }}">Check your Microphone</a></h4>
</p>
<p>
    For each session, you will log in to the website
    with the username and password that have been provided to you.
    Each session consists of three parts, first you will make recordings
    of you reading a few sentences outloud, then you will do a training, and
    finally you will record some more sentences at the end.
