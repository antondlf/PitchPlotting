              This is a demo version of an app meant to facilitate learning L2 intonation.
              An experiment testing this app is currently being hosted in this site.
              This demo features an example sentence in Italian through which you can test out the app.
          </p>
        <p>
            No personal information is collected through this demo and none of it will be used by the authors
            for any reason. Audio recordings and plots will be temporarily stored on the server, but deleted once the "Menu"
            button at the end is clicked. There is also a scheduled removal of demo files in case you forget to press that button at the end.
