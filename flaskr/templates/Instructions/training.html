    Once you’re done with the initial recordings,
    you will be automatically taken to the training
    section of the module, which features the following interface:
</p>
{% if condition == 'a' %}
<img width=25% src="{{ url_for('/instructions.get_image', filename='training_interface.png') }}">
<p>
    In this interface you will be shown a plot of the intonation with
    the words aligned at their corresponding intonational events.
    Examine this plot and try to pronounce the sentence for yourself.
    Then, you should press the “Play Recording” button,
    which will play a recording of a native speaker pronouncing
    the sentence. Press “Record”, wait for the “Go!” sign,
    and try to imitate the native speaker’s production.
    Once you press “Stop”, you will be redirected to another page
    (this may take a few seconds to process).
</p>
<img width="25%" src="{{ url_for('/instructions.get_image', filename='post_trial.png') }}">
<p>
    This page will display a plot of your intonation against
    the native speaker, so you can compare both traces and see
    what you did right and what you did wrong. The example
    here is from a learner who hasn't quite hit the right intonation
    pattern but is almost there. You can see that the second syllable
    has quite a different intonation when compared to the native speaker,
    but the rest of the sentence aligns. You can evaluate your own intonation
    visually like this, and you also have the opportunity to listen to the native
    speaker again to get a better idea of where you went wrong by listening
    back to yourself.
</p>
{% elif condition == 'b' %}
<img width="25%" src="{{ url_for('/instructions.get_image', filename='control_training.png') }}">
<p>
    In this interface you will be asked to listen to a native speaker,
    which you can do by pressing “Play Recording”.
    You should try to pronounce the sentence,
    listen to the native speaker, and then record yourself
    (using the “Record” button) imitating the native speaker’s intonation.
</p>
<img width="25%" src="{{ url_for('/instructions.get_image', filename='control_post.png') }}">
<p>
    You will then be redirected to another page where you will be able
    to listen to the native speaker once more before moving on to the
    next sentence.
