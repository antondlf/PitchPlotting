<p>
Well done! Now for the training. 
</p>
<p>
In this section you will imitate a native speaker and compare your intonation with theirs.
</p>

{% if condition == 'a' %}
<p> You'll see plots of the native speaker's pitch over time to help you visualize their intonation. We'll also show you how your intonation compares.
</p>
{% endif %}

<p>
You’ll try each sentence two times so you can apply what you learn. Then you’ll do the same sentence as a question.
</p>
<p>
As before, you can click the buttons or press the spacebar to advance through them in order.
